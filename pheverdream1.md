My fellow retards – 

I wait many long months to write this post. Since I am accumulated now, now is time to share with you. I introduce you (degenerates) to what will become the greatest upside play in crypto in years. Ignore at the risk of living for the rest of your life with knowledge that you cucked yourself.

Some plot details:

CEO / founder is mechanical engineering phd autist. He used to run ConsenSys’ energy team. Bonus – he fluently speaks mandarin, kind of like Texas-size vitalik, both are on the spectrum levels smart. 

CTO is a masters in physics. He implemented both a bitcoin and ethereum wallet in a custom hardware stack.

Investors – Joe Lubin and Consensys

The GridPlus team has been building their hardware wallet for 4 years. The past few months it has sold like crazy – hockey stick growth. Team has already started another 10,000-unit production run.

The team has designed and implemented an off-chain scaling / privacy solution called PHONON. Specification [here](phonon.network/). But since I know many of you autists can’t read a spec on your own, I’ll lay out some details.

PHONON is not your average retarded DAO. It actually serves a purpose and does something. The TLDR is a smart contract locks value and only allows the private key which is generated within a secure enclave on a specialized chip to sign (move) that value. In other words, users lock up funds and push the ability to move those funds to pieces of hardware. Once these funds are locked up, it is a complete black box. This is more secure and leaks less information than the most advanced obfuscation math out there - zero knowledge proofs. The reason is that transfers happen in a secure channel between two pieces of hardware—nothing is broadcast for a community to verify. There is no proof of work or proof of stake on these transfers. This is end-to-end encrypted tunnels where private keys are generated and destroyed. Only when a user wants to go back to chain to claim the locked funds is a transaction recorded to the chain. That means the tens, hundreds or thousands of transfers that happen in the meantime leave no trace, they are perfectly hidden, and the system scales quadratically with the number of users.

No project comes closer to achieve the anonymity of actual cash.

At a high level, PHONON allows for secure hardware to pass private keys via secure channels. This means users can finally use crypto without broadcasting for all of globohomo to see. No blockchain analytics are possible. There are thousands of these secure hardware devices (Lattices) in the market. Dozens more are ordered each day. Thousands more will enter the market in the next 12 months. Imagine 50,000 units, about 5 seconds per transaction, this network will be able to handle thousands of TPS this year alone, all while keeping each transaction 100% private.

There is an active discord with thousands of users. They anxiously await details of the governance token that will manage the PHONON network. These PHONON tokens will implement the parameters of the PHONON network. They will likely also implement some form of revenue share from the fees generated by the PHONON network.

There is nothing like this that exists. Every shitcoin out there relies on some software implementation to potentially solve some nebulous problem. That’s cute. PHONON is backed by  a full custom hardware stack. The hardware has been pen tested by private researchers for 3 years and has been in deployment since Q4 2020. No exploits have been found.

This is a new paradigm of using crypto. We can rely on our hardware overlords and remove humans from the equation. No inflation through proof of stake rewards. No inflation through proof of work. This system is brilliant and fundamentally changes how we can think about actually using crypto. It is the autonomous platform of the future. Further, even if the globohomo wanted to knock out bitcoin and Ethereum, the assets could still be transferred on the PHONON network, even if the main chains have ground to a halt. There is no stopping this. PHONON prevents you losing access to value in the event of a solar flare or widespread attempt to shut off crypto networks.

Truly private end to end transfers of value. Think about what this allows for. Not just send transactions, entire stacks built on the PHONON primitive. This is a new foundational element to crypto. It is first being built to support Ethereum, but it will likely be extended to other smart contract chains. The potential is limitless. Just imagine a DEX that spans across all smart contracting platforms + bitcoin. One where nobody can see the trades that happen. Everything that is transferred is between units of secure hardware. This will connect all chains together in a fully decentralized and trustless way. No more globohomo packet sniffers and network analyzers building profiles of accounts and activity and tying it back to you, dear retard. A crypto-future with privacy as the 0 layer is the only one I want to be a part of. Only cucks and shills will disagree.

Great, I’ve convinced you, a retard, to want to buy PHONON. Well sucks for you because you can’t.

The team isn’t selling PHONON, they aren’t creating any for themselves either. Instead, they are allowing the community to burn their GRID tokens to receive PHONON in exchange. Rumor has it that the team and company will be sending the vast majority of their own GRID to the 0x000 address so that PHONON is a fully community run project. This level of ethics in unparalleled in this cesspool of an ecosystem.

The previous has been gathered from the GridPlus project discord over the past few years. The next bit is speculation. Rumors in the discord suggest that each GRID will be burned for 155 PHONON tokens.

That GRID’s peak marketcap is under $100m at the time of this writing is hilarious. This project is backed by possibly the largest crypto company in the world (ConsenSys), has a fully functional hardware device in market (Lattice1) and is about to launch the most functional and useful DAO to ever exist.

I will write one post a day until the Phonon marketcap is $14b

Feel free to ignore and stay poor, Pajeet. I’m riding with PHONON and the Lattice1. [Not financial advice – for entertainment purposes only]. PHONON god out.
